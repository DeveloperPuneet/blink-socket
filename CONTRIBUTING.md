# Contributing to Blink-Socket
First off, thank you for considering contributing to Blink-Socket! 🎉
We want this project to grow with your ideas, bug fixes, and improvements. To make the process smooth and collaborative, please follow these guidelines.

## 📌 How Can I Contribute?
**1. Reporting Bugs**

Check the issue tracker
|  to make sure the bug hasn’t already been reported.

Use the Bug Report template (if available).

Include:

Clear steps to reproduce

Expected vs. actual behavior

Screenshots or logs (if relevant)

Your environment (OS, Node/Python/other runtime versions, etc.)

**2. Suggesting Features**

Open an issue with the Feature Request template.

Explain:

What problem the feature solves

A rough idea of implementation (if you have one)

Why it adds value to the project

**3. Submitting Code**

Fork the repo and create a new branch:

```git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name```


Make your changes with clean, documented code.

Run tests (if available) and ensure nothing breaks.

```Commit with clear messages:

```

Push and open a Pull Request (PR) against main.

**✅ Pull Request Guidelines**

Keep PRs focused (1 feature/bug per PR).

Update relevant documentation (README, examples, etc.).

Make sure your code passes linting/tests.

Be open to feedback during review – code reviews help us all level up.

**📂 Code Style**

Follow the existing code style in the repo.

Use meaningful variable and function names.

Write comments where logic is complex.

**🧪 Testing**

Add tests for new functionality whenever possible.

Ensure all existing tests pass before submitting.
